### What is the purpose of this project?

1. To get a brief idea of what the good _Side Project_ is.
   - Before beginning my life as a college student, I've done some researches about how to succeed in the University of Waterloo. 
   - Lots of people mentioned doing side projects is the best way to get a good first coop job. 
   - But my only programming experience is from high school courses with Java, and there was a narrow spectrum of projects I can conduct.
   - So, to enhance my ground knowledge in python and widen my ability, I started to build codes.
3. To start off and learn to use tools for _Data Science_.
4. To learn to documentize my work and post it on github so that I can organize my works neatly.
